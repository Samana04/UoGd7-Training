# Document Accessibility
Providing documents in a range of formats will enable people with different abilities and learning styles to choose the format that works best for them.

Word documents and PDFs uploaded to your website must be formatted and edited adequately for accessibility. The University of Guelph's **Diversity and Human Rights (DHR)** department has a [web page dedicated to helping you create accessible documents](https://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/accessibility/information-and-communication-document-accessibility).

It is recommended that clients go through their content and ensure their documents are WCAG 2.0 AA compliant.
