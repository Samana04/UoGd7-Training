## Accessibility, The AODA, and WCAG 2.0
Accessible design is good for all. Accessible design and the principles of universal design, can lessen the frustrations of users who use your website. An accessible website is beneficial to all users and certainly to the organizations that create them because it means their website is better able to reach all members of its target audience.

**The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA)** became law on June 13, 2005. Under this landmark legislation, the government of Ontario has developed mandatory accessibility standards that identifies, removes, and prevents barriers for people with disabilities. Today, 15.5% of Ontarioâ€™s population has a disability and this number will continue to grow as the population ages.

Beginning January 1, 2021, all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet **WCAG 2.0 Level AA**. **WCAG 2.0** is an internationally accepted standard for web accessibility developed by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**, an international team of experts. Following these guidelines should make it easier for everyone to access your website and content.

### Quick notes on accessibility when creating content
* Don't use low contrast text colours.
* Don't use flashing images or videos.
* If using videos ensure you also have a transcript or captions available.
* Use headings to structure your info logically, not for aesthetics.
* Create links that can be understood out of context (more info in another section).
