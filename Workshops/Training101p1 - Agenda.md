## Accessibility, The AODA, and WCAG 2.0
Accessible design is good for all. Accessible design and the principles of universal design, can lessen the frustrations of users who use your website. An accessible website is beneficial to all users and certainly to the organizations that create them because it means their website is better able to reach all members of its target audience.

**The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA)** became law on June 13, 2005. Under this landmark legislation, the government of Ontario has developed mandatory accessibility standards that identifies, removes, and prevents barriers for people with disabilities. Today, 15.5% of Ontarioâ€™s population has a disability and this number will continue to grow as the population ages.

Beginning January 1, 2021, all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet **WCAG 2.0 Level AA**. **WCAG 2.0** is an internationally accepted standard for web accessibility developed by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**, an international team of experts. Following these guidelines should make it easier for everyone to access your website and content.

### Quick notes on accessibility when creating content
* Don't use low contrast text colours.
* Don't use flashing images or videos.
* If using videos ensure you also have a transcript or captions available.
* Use headings to structure your info logically, not for aesthetics.
* Create links that can be understood out of context (more info in another section).

### How to Login/Logout

1. Navigate to your website: www.uoguelph.ca/*sitename*/user
2. To `login` use your Central Login ID and Password in the user login fields.
3. To `logout` select or click the `logout` option located on the menu bar.

### How to Perform Administration and Content Tasks

To add any type of pre-defined content, the methods are the same. When Logged in as a Site Manager or Content Creator the first bar at the top of the page is called the **Administration Menu Bar** and it allows users with the correct permissions to add/view/delete/edit content as well as other administration specific tasks.

### Finding, Filtering, and Editing Content

All content created on your website can be viewed by selecting the `Find Content` shortcut located on the Administration Menu shortcut bar, or by selecting `Content` on the Administration Menu bar itself.

To Edit content you can search using the filter drop-down menus for a particular content type and then select `edit` for that particular item.

### Creating A Basic Page

1. On the Administration bar, select `Add Content`.
2. Select `Page`.
3. Enter a **Title**.
4. If you have [Page Categories](../taxonomies.md#categories) defined, select the appropriate one.
5. In the **body field** enter what you want displayed on your web page.

*Please see below on how to use the content editor*
6. If you want to add any files to download attach them using the **File Attachment** option.
7. If you want this web page to be accessed through your menus check the `provide a menu link`.
    1. Enter an appropriate **Title** and **Description**.
    2. In the `Parent item` drop down menu select which menu heading you want the new link to be accessed through. *Example: If it is an event select event to have it as a sublink there.*
8. If you have the proper authority to publish right away, select `Published` in `Publishing options`.
9. Select `Save` when you are done.

## How To Use The WYSIWYG Editor and Additional Tips.

There are a few items that need to be explained with our current version of our WYSIWYG editor until the updates come down the line. The items are as such:

1. How to add images within the body section.
2. How to add tables.
3. How to create links that are **WCAG 2.0 AA** compliant.

### To Create an Event

1. Select `Add Content` at the top of the administration bar.
2. Select `Event` in the list.
3. Enter a **Title**. *(Mandatory)*
4. Enter the starting and ending **Dates and Time**. *(Mandatory)*
5. Enter a **Location**.
6. In the **Body field** enter the details and summary of the information.
7. [Select your Section](../taxonomies.md#Sections) if you have defined one.
  * For sections a **Taxonomy** for `Event_headings` needs to be created. The `Sections` datafield is where content creators can add data that doesn't conform to the already predetermined Events feature such as *Cost*, or *Extra Directions*, or  *Dinner Menu Items*. A Section does not need to be added and can be left blank.
8. Add a `feature image` if there is one for the event, such as a poster image.  Add a descriptive **Alt Text** - a **Caption** is optional. *Note: Any information available on the image should also be available in your summary.*
9. Add any files relevant to the Event and enter a related website for your event *(if there is a page dedicated to the event)* with a descriptive title.
10. Select the Save button when you are done.
