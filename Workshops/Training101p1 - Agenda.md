## Accessibility, The AODA, and WCAG 2.0

### Quick notes on accessibility when creating content
* Don't use low contrast text colours.
* Don't use flashing images or videos.
* If using videos ensure you also have a transcript or captions available.
* Use headings to structure your info logically, not for aesthetics.
* Create links that can be understood out of context (more info in another section).

## How to Login/Logout

1. Navigate to your website: www.uoguelph.ca/*sitename*/user
2. To `login` use your Central Login ID and Password in the user login fields.
3. To `logout` select or click the `logout` option located on the menu bar.

## How to Perform Administration and Content Tasks

To add any type of pre-defined content, the methods are the same. When Logged in as a Site Manager or Content Creator the first bar at the top of the page is called the **Administration Menu Bar** and it allows users with the correct permissions to add/view/delete/edit content as well as other administration specific tasks.

## Finding, Filtering, and Editing Content

All content created on your website can be viewed by selecting the `Find Content` shortcut located on the Administration Menu shortcut bar, or by selecting `Content` on the Administration Menu bar itself.

To Edit content you can search using the filter drop-down menus for a particular content type and then select `edit` for that particular item.
