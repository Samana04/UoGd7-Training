## Accessibility, The AODA, and WCAG 2.0


## Governance 
* First a note about the roles (3 main roles).

### Roles and Responsibilities
There are three main roles we have implemented with our CMS. Site Managers and Content Creators and Content Editors.

**Site Managers** 
Can edit and manage users, basic site layout, changing view categories, Titles, change the number of items to display on view panes, creation of menus, and configuration of site specific taxonomies. The role of a site manager is to ensure AODA compliancy and to monitor for any broken links and misspellings with the help of SiteImprove. We recommend that there only be 1-2 Site Managers to ensure that site maintenance and conformity to WCAG 2.0 Standards is kept and that the ability to divide up responsibility is easier to achieve and enforce.

**Content Creators / Editors** Can create and edit content types such as Banners, Events, Basic Pages, News Articles, and others. There are two types of Content Creators: **Authors** and **Editors**. 

- Authors can create, edit, and publish/unpublish their own content. 

- Editors can create, edit, and publish/unpublish their own content, as well as edit and unpublish content created by other users.

#### Web Managers / Site Owners
If you have the responsibility of ensuring accessibility on a website, then all the criteria in WCAG are relevant to you (usually on level AA). It is then necessary to have a fundamental understanding of the subject in order to be able to ensure content conforms to the guidelines. It is also important that you communicate and train your web editors & colleagues on how to publish content the ‘accessible way.’ This way, when content is added it furthers your site’s accessibility rather than introducing new accessibility issues. Start out by using tools that can assist you in getting a quick overview of issues. For large websites the effort most likely needs to be prioritized.

The following beginning steps will help you to get started as a site owner:

* Learn About The AODA and Content Editing Standards.
* Document Accessibility (such as generating PDFs)
* Register for a SiteImprove Web Accessibility Course
* Monitor your Website for Accessibility Issues
* Start Creating an idea about SCOPEING and PRIORITIZATION

#### Start Creating an idea about SCOPEING and PRIORITIZATION

### Scopeing and Prioritization
The following things should be thought about as you transition to the Projects Drupal Platform:

1. Create an inventory of content.
2. Scopeing and Prioritization.
3. Workflows

#### Web Inventory 

#### Scoping and prioritizing websites and Web applications

#### Workflow Suggestions
We have created different roles to help facilitate a new type of workflow. Authors, Editors, Site Managers.

* Authours can create their own content - > give this responsibility to anyone who will be contributing content.
* Editors should do just htat, comb the content and make edits and publish/unpublish content.
* Site managers should constantly monitor through various tools like SiteImprove to ensure the content that has been published has no mispellings, broken links, appropriate alt tags and colour contrast for images, etc.
