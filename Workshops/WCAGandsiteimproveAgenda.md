4. Top 5 accessibility procedures

## Accessibility, The AODA, and WCAG 2.0
Accessible design is good for all. Large public-sector organizations usually have large, multi-page, multi-department—and often cumbersome—websites. Accessible design and the principles of universal design, with their emphasis on clear, streamlined and flexible presentation, content and navigation, can lessen the frustrations of users who use your website. An accessible website is beneficial to all users and certainly to the organizations that create them because it means their website is better able to reach all members of its target audience.

**The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA)** became law on June 13, 2005. Under this landmark legislation, the government of Ontario has developed mandatory accessibility standards that identifies, removes, and prevents barriers for people with disabilities. Disability impacts the lives of many Ontarians, and the numbers of people with disabilities is increasing. Today, 15.5% of Ontario’s population has a disability and this number will continue to grow as the population ages.

The AODA requires that beginning January 1, 2014, new public websites, significantly refreshed websites and any web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level A**. And beginning January 1, 2021, all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet **WCAG 2.0 Level AA**. WCAG 2.0 is an internationally accepted standard for web accessibility developed by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**, an international team of experts. Following these guidelines should make it easier for everyone to access your website and content.

WCAG 2.0 has 12 guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. For each guideline, there are testable success criteria, which are ranked at 3 levels: A, AA, AAA.

## Siteimprove Guidelines
In this section we will talk to clients about:

1. Siteimprove access and how to get it.
2. What siteimprove does and how to navigate its basic features.
3. How to fix spelling mistakes and broken links.
4. Briefly talk about the accessibility tab and accessible document creation.

### Getting Access to SiteImprove
If you are a web content owner, you should have already received your SiteImprove credentials. If not, [contact Diversity & Human Rights](http://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/) and they can add you to the list and give you access to the system for your content site area.

### What is SiteImprove Quality Assurance?
* SiteImprove is a service that regularly crawls your organizational website and tracks any broken links, spelling errors, and accessibility issues.
* Fixing any spelling or link errors reported by SiteImprove requires the user to edit a page within the University of Guelph's content management system, Drupal 7.
* SiteImprove does NOT affect or edit pages within any site.
* Users can [login to the SiteImprove](http://my.siteimprove.com/) to view detailed information about their departments site.
* SiteImprove can email users every five (5) days with a report on a site.
* Users who maintain multiple sites can view a report on each of those specific sites by selecting the appropriate Group from the dropdown menu at the top of the dashboard titled (ADD TITLE).
* SiteImprove does rank pages on the number of errors based on a scale of 0-10 (10 is best).

### Introduction to SiteImprove Quality Assurance
* Login to Siteimprove

Once inside SiteImprove, you will have access to a customized dashboard reflecting the report of your specific site. If you maintain or have access to multiple sites, those sites are listed under the Group drop down menu.

SiteImprove Quality Assurance is composed of four modules:
* QA Overview – provides an overall view of a sites health, highlighting broken links and misspellings that affect the most pages.
* Links – specific details concerning pages with broken links such as frequent broken links, external links, etc.
* Spelling – specific details concerning the misspellings located across your site.
* Inventory – provides information regarding quantity and types of documents available on your site along with information regarding phone numbers, email addresses, media, etc.

SiteImprove Quality Assurance also comes bundled with an Accessibility tab for viewing your site’s compliance to WCAG 2.0 standards.
Please note that SiteImprove Quality Assurance reports are based on the most recent site scan and may not reflect any recently published changes. You can initiate a rescan of any page at any time by clicking the button labed`rescan`.

### Correcting Spelling Mistakes
* In order to look at spelling mistakes specifically, you can click on the number within the Misspellings button within the dashboard. You can also access the misspelling page using the navigation menu, under spelling.
* This will take you to a page which lists all the misspellings on this section of the website.
* To see which page a particular spelling mistake is on, you can click on the magnifying glass.
* This will then open a new tab and take you to a page highlighting your spelling mistakes within the body text in red. Misspellings and Potential Misspellings are listed on the menu to the left.

#### Potential Misspellings
Potential misspellings are words that SiteImprove does not recognize, and will need review. To review a potential misspelling do the following:
1. Click on it and a menu will open with suggestions and other options.
2. You can either confirm the misspelling - in which case it becomes highlighted in red and registered as a misspelling on the `Quality Assurance` pane - Ignore it (in the case of foreign language words) or add it to the dictionary - in which case the potential misspelling will disappear and any other instances of this word will stop being registered as potential misspellings.

#### Fixing Misspellings
* In order to fix a misspelling, you will need to log into your website and navigate to the page where the misspelling is located and fix it manually.
* After you have made the necessary change, you can go back to the page within SiteImprove and click on the `Recheck Page` button in the top left of the page.

### Fixing a Broken Link
1. Log in as usual and pick your site to get to the overview page, and then click on the number within the “Broken Links” circle.
2. The next page outlines all of the broken links in your site. Take note of the column to the right of this called “pages”. This tells you on how many pages this particular link is found (and broken) on.
3. In order to see which pages a link is broken on, you can hover over the box with the number of pages in it and a “+” will appear. Click this to expand the box and list all of the pages in which this broken link can be found.
4. Clicking on one of the results will then open a page report in a new tab and show you where on the page the broken link is.
5. You will need to log into your Drupal Website and fix the broken link in the editor. Then, when the link is fixed you can click the `recheck` button/option the page and update Siteimprove.

## Best Practices
In the following section we will discuss:

1. Best practices to begin right away.

### Practices
The best way to begin is to start small and work towards harder criteria. [SiteImprove](http://my.siteimprove.com) will help highlight and create reports of where your website needs improvement.

#### 1. Start with the basics – Broken Links
Broken links negatively affect users perception of your website, yet all too often it is the basics like this that are overlooked. There should be no broken links on your website.

#### 2. 150 characters or less for metadata.
Keep it short. Metadata includes things like Alt descriptions, summaries, and other descriptive text. Meta descriptions are commonly used on search engine result pages (SERPs) to display preview snippets for a given page. Ideally, Meta descriptions should be no more than 150 characters or else you risk important information being cut or to long to be useful.

#### 3. Keep it small
A simple thing to overlook when adding documents and media files to a website is their size. As a general rule of thumb, documents and files should not be bigger than 10MB otherwise they will cause a range of annoying problems for the user. They will slow the speed of your site, cause problems if you have a responsive design and put a serious dent in mobile users data plans.

#### 4. Link it right
Website link texts can be problematic. While many editors are aware of how to correctly use link texts, time, pressure and repetition can cause complacency. The outcome is often that people revert to using ‘read more’ or ‘click here’, which are not only inaccessible to a number of users but also make no sense when taken out of context.

#### 5. Testing 1, 2, 3
Use SiteImprove to help in assisting and finding accessibility issues such as broken links, misspellings, and WCAG 2.0 Accessibility testing.

## Accessibility Top 5
The fowling items should be learned and stickied for Content Creators and Site Managers. As content creators and managers you will not necessarily need to know all the WCAG 2.0 details.
The following list is something however we should all be familiar with:

### 1. Text for everyone
* Make sure all text can be highlighted and read aloud so that screen readers and reading tools can access them.
* Avoid images of text where possible. Where not, make sure that text alternatives are equivalent.
* Provide alternative text for images. These must reflect the purpose of the image:
  * Decorative: no alternative text.
  * Having a function: Describe the functionality.
  * Linking: Describe destination.

### 2. Versatility
Create a website that can be used by as many as possible, in as many ways as possible according to user needs.
* All functionality can be used without a mouse – from the keyboard alone.
* All functionality can be used with a mouse.
* Users can adapt color and font according to specific needs.
* Ensure none of your content will cause seizures - **avoid** rapidly flashing content.

### 3. Association
* Text, headings, buttons, fields etc. that are logically connected must also be visually connected.
* Make sure not to give instructions based solely on a location of content, such as ‘In the box to your right’. Supplement with a heading as well.
* Make link texts that can be read out of context. Avoid ‘Click here’, ‘Read more’.

### 4. Color for everyone
* Make sure that the color of the background and the color of the text are insufficient contrast to each other. That way people with low vision can also read it.
* Make sure that you do not give information by use of color alone, such as saying "In the green box you will find". Otherwise it can create problems for both users with low vision or no vision, or people with color blindness.

### 5. Robustness
* Have a consistent design throughout the website.
* Follow known website conventions.
* Follow the standard for the format you are publishing in (for example HTML 5 syntax) - this will optimize your website for many different platforms and user agents.
