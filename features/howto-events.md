# How to Create an Event
The Events feature allows **Content Creators** to add events to the website and display them in a Listing Page view, a Weekly Events view, a Monthly Calendar view, an Event Detail Page view, and an Upcoming Events Teaser List view. Any event can be highlighted (or “featured”) on any page using the Featured Items block. Site visitors can also browse for events by date and event category.

7. Select your **Section** if you have defined one.
  * For sections a **Taxonomy** for `Event_headings` needs to be created by the Site Manager. Example `Sections`: *Cost*, or *Extra Directions*, or  *Dinner Menu Items*. A Section does not need to be added and can be left blank.
8. Add a `feature image` if there is one for the event, such as a poster image.  
* Add a descriptive **Alternative Text** 
* **Caption** is optional.
