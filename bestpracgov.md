# Best Practices for Website Content Creation and Accessibility

## A Word about Accessibility and The AODA
Accessible design is good for all. Large public-sector organizations usually have large, multi-page, multi-department—and often cumbersome—websites. How many times has someone tried to access information on such a site only to be frustrated and give up? How many times has that happened to you? It’s a common experience for people both with and without disabilities.

**The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA)** became law on June 13, 2005. Under this landmark legislation, the government of Ontario has developed mandatory accessibility standards that identifies, removes, and prevents barriers for people with disabilities. Disability impacts the lives of many Ontarians, and the numbers of people with disabilities is increasing. Today, 15.5% of Ontario’s population has a disability and this number will continue to grow as the population ages.

Accessible design and the principles of universal design, with their emphasis on clear, streamlined and flexible presentation, content and navigation, can lessen such frustrations. An accessible website is beneficial to all users and certainly to the organizations that create them because it means their website is better able to reach all members of its target audience.

Redeveloping a website to better serve people with disabilities also has these additional benefits:

Better Search Engine Optimization (SEO):
* More headings and subheadings, as well as alt (alternative) texts for images, means more content is available for search engines to crawl over.

Accessible design works well with good mobile design:
* No organization can ignore the popularity of mobile devices to access the web. A university or college looking to recruit more students will want a website that works well on a small screen. Walk-in clinics and ERs will want information on their locations and hours of operation easily accessed on a cellphone. Accessible design and responsive design share many best practices; for example, always including keyboard commands for navigation.

Reaching people less fluent online, people with low literacy or those who are not fluent in the language of the site:
* A university or college may also be looking to recruit continuing education or international students. A city website listing amenities and tourist attractions may be accessed by would-be vacationers speaking a myriad of languages. Accessible design includes these helpful elements: clear, simple and consistent language, navigation and links; supplemental illustrations; blocks of information divided into groups with appropriately tagged headings and subheadings; text that does not blink or flash; and online forms that provide users enough time to read and use content.

Reaching people accessing websites in noisy environments or with hearing disabilities:
* Captioning of audio content is essential for this group.

Reaching people with low-bandwidth connections or older technologies:
* An organization cannot assume that everyone’s access to the web is of the same quality. Accessible design’s emphasis on alt texts and text alternatives for all multimedia and images allows users to bypass these bandwidth-hogging elements without losing any information.

## WCAG 2.0 Principles, Guidelines and Criteria
The AODA stipulates that that beginning January 1, 2014, new public websites, significantly refreshed websites and any web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0** Level A. And beginning January 1, 2021, all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA. WCAG 2.0 is an internationally accepted standard for web accessibility developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international team of experts. Following these guidelines should make it easier for everyone to access your website and content.

WCAG 2.0 has 12 guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. For each guideline, there are testable success criteria, which are ranked at 3 levels: A, AA, AAA.

## Accessibility Top 5
As content creators and managers you will not necessarily need to know all the WCAG 2.0 details. The following list was created with content managers and creators in mind:

### 1. Text for everyone
* Make sure all text can be highlighted and read aloud so that screen readers and reading tools can access them.
* Avoid images of text where possible. Where not, make sure that text alternatives are equivalent.
* Provide alternative text for images. These must reflect the purpose of the image:
  * Decorative: no alternative text.
  * Having a function: Describe the functionality.
  * Linking: Describe destination.

### 2. Versatility
Create a website that can be used by as many as possible, in as many ways as possible according to user needs.
* All functionality can be used without a mouse – from the keyboard alone.
* All functionality can be used with a mouse
* Users can adapt color and font according to specific needs.
* Ensure none of your content will cause seizures, avoid rapidly flashing content.

### 3. Association
* Text, headings, buttons, fields etc. that are logically connected must also be visually connected.
* Make sure not to give instructions based solely on a location of content, such as ‘In the box to your right…’. Supplement with a heading also.
* Make link texts that can be read out of context. Avoid ‘Click here’, ‘Read more’.

### 4. Color for everyone
* Make sure that the color of the background and the color of the text are in sufficient contrast to each other. That way people with low vision can also read it.
* Make sure that you do not give information by use of color alone, such as saying "In the green box you will find". Otherwise it can create problems for both users with low vision or no vision, or people with color blindness.

### 5. Robustness
* Have a consistent design throughout the website.
* Follow known website conventions.
* Follow the standard for the format you are publishing in (for example HTML 5 syntax) - this will optimize your website for many different platforms and user agents.

## Best Practices
Some best practices to get you started when managaing/editing your website and content is to begin small and work towards harder criteria. [SiteImprove](http://my.siteimprove.com) will help highlight and create reports of where your website needs improvement.

### 1. Start with the basics – Broken Links
Broken links negatively affect a user’s perception of your website, yet all too often it’s the basics like this that are overlooked. To ensure your site is always at its best, set a policy that there should be no broken links on your website. If you’re short on time or resources, make the task more manageable by setting a policy that is restricted to your most popular pages within the last seven days.

### 2. 150 characters or less for metadata.
Keep it short. Meta descriptions are commonly used on search engine result pages (SERPs) to display preview snippets for a given page. Ideally, Meta descriptions should be no more than 150 characters or else you risk important information being cut and dampened SEO efforts that result in less website traffic. To mitigate this our policy is that all metadata such as Alt text and descriptions should be less than 150 characters.

### 3. Keep it small
A simple thing to overlook when adding documents and media files to a website is their size. As a general rule of thumb, documents and files shouldn’t be bigger than 10MB otherwise they’ll cause a range of annoying problems for the user. They’ll slow the speed of your site, cause problems if you have a responsive design and put a serious dent in mobile user’s data plans. Size limits for files have been instituted but it is a good idea to be vigilant yourself and personally reduce your file sizes if applicable.

### 4. Link it right
Website link texts can be problematic. While many editors are aware of how to correctly use link texts, time, pressure and repetition can cause complacency. The outcome is often that people revert to using ‘read more’ or ‘click here’, which are not only inaccessible to a number of users but also make no sense when taken out of context.

### 5. Testing 1, 2, 3
Use SiteImprove to help in assisting and finding accessibility issues such as broken links, misspellings, and accessibility testing.
