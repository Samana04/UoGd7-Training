## WCAG 2.0 Principles, Guidelines and Criteria
The AODA stipulates that that beginning January 1, 2014, new public websites, significantly refreshed websites and any web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0** Level A. And beginning January 1, 2021, all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA. WCAG 2.0 is an internationally accepted standard for web accessibility developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international team of experts. Following these guidelines should make it easier for everyone to access your website and content.

WCAG 2.0 has 12 guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. For each guideline, there are testable success criteria, which are ranked at 3 levels: A, AA, AAA.

## Accessibility Top 5
As content creators and managers you will not necessarily need to know all the WCAG 2.0 details. The following list was created with content managers and creators in mind:

### 1. Text for everyone
* Make sure all text can be highlighted and read aloud so that screen readers and reading tools can access them.
* Avoid images of text where possible. Where not, make sure that text alternatives are equivalent.
* Provide alternative text for images. These must reflect the purpose of the image:
  * Decorative: no alternative text.
  * Having a function: Describe the functionality.
  * Linking: Describe destination.

### 2. Versatility
Create a website that can be used by as many as possible, in as many ways as possible according to user needs.
* All functionality can be used without a mouse – from the keyboard alone.
* All functionality can be used with a mouse
* Users can adapt color and font according to specific needs.
* Ensure none of your content will cause seizures - **avoid** rapidly flashing content.

### 3. Association
* Text, headings, buttons, fields etc. that are logically connected must also be visually connected.
* Make sure not to give instructions based solely on a location of content, such as ‘In the box to your right…’. Supplement with a heading also.
* Make link texts that can be read out of context. Avoid ‘Click here’, ‘Read more’.

### 4. Color for everyone
* Make sure that the color of the background and the color of the text are in sufficient contrast to each other. That way people with low vision can also read it.
* Make sure that you do not give information by use of color alone, such as saying "In the green box you will find". Otherwise it can create problems for both users with low vision or no vision, or people with color blindness.

### 5. Robustness
* Have a consistent design throughout the website.
* Follow known website conventions.
* Follow the standard for the format you are publishing in (for example HTML 5 syntax) - this will optimize your website for many different platforms and user agents.
