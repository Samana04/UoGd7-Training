# What is Drupal?
## A Brief Description
It is often thought of a website as a collection of static pages, perhaps with some functions like a blog or a comments section. When they go to manage their site, they are thinking in terms of a tree-like hierarchy of pages that they will edit.

**The University of Guelph Business Web Solutions** department uses a *Content Managment System (CMS)* called *Drupal*. *Drupal* on the other hand, treats most content types as variations on the same concept: a *Node* (more on this in a moment). Static pages, blog posts, and news items (some possible node types) are all stored in the same way, and the site's navigation structure is designed separately by editing menus, views (lists of content), and blocks (side content which often have links to different site sections).

## The Flexibility of Nodes
 Essentially, a node is a set of related bits of information. When you create a new blog post, you are not only defining its body text, but also its title, content, author link, creation date, taxonomy (tags), etc. Some of these elements will be shown by the theme layer when the node is displayed. Others are meta-data that control when the node will show up at all - such as taxonomy or publishing status.

## Regions & Blocks
![Image of Block Areas highlighted](images/Block_Areas.jpg)

Pages on your *Drupal* site are laid out in Regions. These can include the header, footer, sidebars, and main content regions. Your theme may define additional regions.

Blocks are discrete chunks of information that are displayed in the regions of your site's pages. Blocks can take the form of static chunks of HTML or text, menus (which are for site navigation), the output from modules (e.g. hot forum topics), or dynamic listings that you've created yourself (e.g. a list of upcoming events).

## Users, Permissions, and Roles
Every visitor to your site, whether they have an account and log in or visit the site anonymously, is considered a user to *Drupal*. Every user when created also has a role assigned to them, these roles grant the user certain permissions. When those users are logged in, *Drupal* will let them do the actions that role has permissions for.

## About AODA and Content Editing Standards.
**AODA Standards** â€“ effective January 2014 website content changes must comply with provincial legislation known as the **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)**. The Standards governing websites is called the **Web Content Accessibility Guidlines (WCAG) 2.0** *Level A* compliance was required in 2014 and *Level AA* compliance is required by 2021. Recommendations that will assist content editors in maintaining these standards are identified and outlined in this user manual as well as in the following list:
* Ensure all images added to your site have *descriptive* Alt tags no less than 100 characters. In the event of a purely decorative image no Alt text needs to be added.
* [U of G Web Accessibility site](https://www.uoguelph.ca/accessibility/web/).
* [The Siteimprove website application](http://siteimprove.com/) is used for tracking technical compliance - for user training **Contact Diversity & Human Rights**.
* *Required fields*: Fields flagged as required must be completed for AODA compliance.

## Users
### How to Login/Logout
1.	 Navigate to your website: www.uoguelph.ca/*sitename*
2.	 Login (using your Central Login ID and Password).
3.	 Logout (click link on top right).

### Adding Users
Request that new users attempt to login to the site - this provides their Username (which is their Central Login-ID for U of G staff).

1. At the top of the administration bar select `People`.
2. Either use the filter or scroll down to find the Username.
3. Select appropriate Username.
4. Select Role (i.e. editor).
5. Enter *random* password information (It will not be retained since the Central Login ID and Password will override and provide access to the website)
6. SAVE

*Note: If you already know the Central Login-ID and email address, or the user is not U of G authenticated, accounts can be set-up without having the user attempt the initial login.*
