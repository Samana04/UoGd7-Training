# Tips on getting started
Some best practices to get you started when managaing/editing your website and content is to begin small and work towards harder criteria. [SiteImprove](http://my.siteimprove.com) will help highlight and create reports of where your website needs improvement.

## 1. Start with the basics – Broken Links
Broken links negatively affect a user’s perception of your website, yet all too often it’s the basics like this that are overlooked. There should be no broken links on your website.

## 2. 150 characters or less for metadata.
Keep it short. Metadata includes things like Alt descriptions, summaries, and other descriptive text. Meta descriptions are commonly used on search engine result pages (SERPs) to display preview snippets for a given page. Ideally, Meta descriptions should be no more than 150 characters or else you risk important information being cut or to long to be useful.

## 3. Keep it small
A simple thing to overlook when adding documents and media files to a website is their size. As a general rule of thumb, documents and files shouldn’t be bigger than 10MB otherwise they’ll cause a range of annoying problems for the user. They’ll slow the speed of your site, cause problems if you have a responsive design and put a serious dent in mobile user’s data plans.

## 4. Link it right
Website link texts can be problematic. While many editors are aware of how to correctly use link texts, time, pressure and repetition can cause complacency. The outcome is often that people revert to using ‘read more’ or ‘click here’, which are not only inaccessible to a number of users but also make no sense when taken out of context.

## 5. Testing 1, 2, 3
Use SiteImprove to help in assisting and finding accessibility issues such as broken links, misspellings, and WCAG 2.0 Accessibility testing.
