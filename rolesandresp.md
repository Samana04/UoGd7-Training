# Roles and Responsibilities
There are three main roles we have implemented with our CMS. Site Managers and Content Creators and Content Editors.

**Site Managers** 
Can edit and manage users, basic site layout, changing view categories, Titles, and number of items to display, creation of menus, and configuration of site specific taxonomies. The role of a site manager is to ensure AODA compliancy and to monitor for any broken links and misspellings using SiteImprove. We recommend that there only be 1-2 Site Managers to ensure that site maintenance and conformity to WCAG 2.0 Standards is kept to the responsibility of site owners.

**Content Creators and Editors** 
Can create and edit content types such as Banners, Events, Basic Pages, News Articles, and others.
