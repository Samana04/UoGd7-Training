# Web Managers / Site Owners
If you have the responsibility of ensuring accessibility on a website, then all the criteria in WCAG are relevant to you (usually on level AA). It is then necessary to have a fundamental understanding of the subject in order to be able to ensure content conforms to the guidelines. It is also important that you communicate and train your web editors & colleagues on how to publish content the ‘accessible way.’ This way, when content is added it furthers your site’s accessibility rather than introducing new accessibility issues. Start out by using tools that can assist you in getting a quick overview of issues. For large websites the effort most likely needs to be prioritized.

The following beginning steps will help you to get started as a site owner:

## Learn About The AODA and Content Editing Standards.
**AODA Standards** – effective January 2014 website content changes must comply with provincial legislation known as the **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)**. The Standards governing websites is called the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0** *Level A* compliance was required in 2014 and *Level AA* compliance is required by 2021. This documentation has some information at the beginning of Chapter 2 to help get you started. You should also visit the [U of G Web Accessibility site](https://www.uoguelph.ca/accessibility/web/) for additional help and resources.

## Register for a SiteImprove Web Accessibility Course

## Monitor your Website for Accessibility Issues
The University of Guelph monitors the accessibility of its websites using an online web governance service called SiteImprove. Once a site is added to SiteImprove, the service will check the site for accessibility issues, broken links, and spelling mistakes that can be found through automated means. If you would like to monitor your University of Guelph website using SiteImprove, contact the University of [Guelph AODA Web team](aodaweb@uoguelph.ca). Be ready to provide the URL of the website you wish to monitor and the name of the department associated with the website.
